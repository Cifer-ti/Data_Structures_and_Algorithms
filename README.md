## Introduction

In this repository, I document my journey of learning and implementing various data structures and algorithms in C. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts and improve problem-solving skills.

## Data Structures

I have implemented the following data structures:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Graph

Each data structure is implemented as a separate C file, providing functions for common operations and demonstrating their usage.

## Algorithms

I have also implemented various algorithms, including:

- Searching algorithms (e.g., Sequential Search, Index Seqeuntial Search, Srdered Linear Search, Binary Search, Hashing)
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)

Similar to the data structures, each algorithm is implemented as a separate C file, accompanied by usage examples and explanations.
